# What are Variables?
Variables are a way to store a value in memory

# Creating Variables in JavaScript
- To create variables in JavaScript, need to use either the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords
- Name your variable anything you want, then set it equal to the value you desire

## Example of Creating JavaScript Variables
```js
var a = 1;
let b = 'two';
const pi = 3.14159265;
```
