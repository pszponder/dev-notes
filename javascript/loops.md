# While Loops
- While loops will run until the condition inside the parenthesis evaluates to `false`
- Best used if you want to run your code for an unspecified amount of time, until the condition becomes false
    - Ex. Running a game inside a while loop until the condition evaluates to 'game over'
- Make sure to prevent going into an infinite loop with a while statement 
    - Condition never evaluates to false and so the loop runs infinately

```js
while (condition) {
    // do stuff
}
```


# For Loops
- Best used when you want your code to execute a specific amount of times

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // do stuff
}
```
