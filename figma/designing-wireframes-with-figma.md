# Create Frames

- Frames dictate the max allowable size where you can place
- The frame represents the device screen size
- Create a mobile and desktop version of the frame
- Always start with mobile first design
  - This is the primary way users interact with your screen
  - It is easier to adapt from mobile to desktop design as opposed to the other way around

# Layout Grid

- Layout grid helps with arranging items on your frame
- Shortcut to show/hide grid:
  - Windows / Linux: `ctrl` + `shift` + `4`
  - Mac: `ctrl` + `G`

## Recommended Layout Grid Defaults

Mobile:

- Columns: 4
- Margin: 24px
- Gutter: 16px

Desktop:

- Columns: 12
- Margin: 64px
- Gutter: 16px

# Content Blocks

- After creating the frames, create the content blocks that will exist in your wireframe
- This helps you with your outline for your content
- Basically create rectangle areas with titles to represent where your content is going to go
- Once you create the content blocks, move those to the side (outside) of the frame and shrink down the width so that you have a sliver outline of all the content and that will exist in your wireframe.
  - You can use this as a reference as you are designing in the frame

# Placeholders

- If you don't have an image or logo, you can create boxes with an x across them to denote a placeholder value
  - Useful for logos, or other images
  - Gray out the boxes

# Menu

- Use Rectangles and draw diagonal lines through it to represent content
- Hamburger menu:
  - Usually open up a side or full screen menu depending on if it is on your phone or on your computer screen
- Icons should be of the same size

# Importing Icons / Images:

- It is recommended to use svg instead of png for images / icons

# Creating Styles for Each Type of Text Element:

- Once you have a piece of text formatted and you want to use the formatting as a template, click on the 4 dots in the text option and add a text style
- Give the text style a name and you can then reuse the style as many times as you want.

# Layers:

- When putting items one on top of another in Figma, you can control their position by bringing items in front or behind each other.
- Select the item and right click on it.
- Then select bring to front or send to back.
